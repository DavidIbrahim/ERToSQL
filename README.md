# ERToSQL

## Project Description
Our android app makes defining a database easier by transforming hand-sketched ER diagrams into SQL code.
You capture the ERD, confirm it and modify the resultant SQL code.
It saves the time and effort of manually creating the database or building computerized diagrams to obtain the code.
It can also be useful in education systems to both students and instructors.

## Usage
You can get your code through 5 Steps:
### 1- Draw
Draw a neat SQL Diagram containing a relationship between two entities, and the entities attributes (unique or regular)

### 3- Check
The captured photo will show the recognised ER shapes, If your photo is not captured correctly or not recognised, you can capture it again.

### 4- Confirm
If all ER shapes are recognised correctly, you can confirm to convert the ER diagram to SQL code.

### 5- Modify
The last step is naming your diagram and altering with the data types in the SQL diagram. You can also save or delete your diagram when you're finished.
